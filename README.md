# Task 03 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier (Bank Marketing Dataset) ðŸŒ³

## Objective
The goal of this task was to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Bank Marketing Dataset  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains details about bank clients such as:
  - Demographics (age, job, marital status, education, etc.)
  - Banking-related features (balance, housing loan, personal loan, etc.)
  - Campaign-related data (contact type, number of contacts, previous outcome)

- **Target Variable:**  
  `y` â†’ whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes` / `no`).

---

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**
   - Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn.
   - Tuned parameters (max depth, criterion).

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

4. **Visualization**
   - Decision Tree plotted with feature names.
   - Feature importance extracted to identify key predictors.

---

## Results
- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~XX% (replace with your result)  
- **Key Features Influencing Prediction:**
  - Duration of last contact
  - Age
  - Previous campaign outcome
  - Balance
